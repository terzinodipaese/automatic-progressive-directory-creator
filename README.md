# automatic-progressive-directory-creator
Very stupid Powershell script to create an arbitrary number of directories with a common prefix, followed by a progressive number. The script creates the folders in the directory you choose. First argument is the folder where the directories will be created, second argument is the prefix, third argument is the number of directories to be created.
